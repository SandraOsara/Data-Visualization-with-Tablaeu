### Project Overview <a name="project_overview"></a>

#### Flight Delays and Cancellations
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page.

The file I used in creating my data visualizations is the flights.csv file - https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/December/5a3b1fad_flight-delays/flight-delays.zip. The other two provided files may be used in conjunction with the flights.csv file, but it was not used alone.

I created four visualizations. Some questions you may attempt to answer include those pertaining to the following areas:

 - Which airlines or airports have the worst delays
 - Which airports have the worst delays
 - What is the most common reason for cancelling flights?
 - Which states have the most cancelled flights?


### Which airlines or airports have the worst delays? <a name="question1"></a>

#### Summary
The above bubble plot shows that all through the year, Southwest Airline Co. has the highest/worse flight delay.

#### Design.
A bubble plot was plotted in which the largest bubble shows the airline with the highest delay all year. This visual is to be readable by all hence the colour that was chosen considered those with colour blindness

### Which airports have the worst delays? <a name="question2"></a>
 

#### Links

#### Summary
The above Visual is a dashboard that shows the different airports and their arrival and departure delays. For both the arrival and the departure delays, Chicago O'Hare International Airport has the highest arrival and departure delays with arrival delays of 98,600 and departure delays of 161,133.

#### Design
A bar chat was plotted for this visual. The Highest bar shows the highest delay all year. This visual is to be readable by all hence the colour that was chosen considered those with colour blindness.

### What is the most common reason for cancelling flights?<a name="question3"></a>
 

#### Links
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sandra1429/viz/CANCELLATIONREASONS_16548993409600/CANCELLATIONREASON?publish=yes

#### Summary.
The above visual shows the different reasons why flights were cancelled and from the figure, we can see that weather is the major reason why most flights are cancelled as 2397 flights have been cancelled due to the weather condition. The next is the airline with a figure of 1260 but we will stick to weather since the difference is high.

#### Design
A pie chart was used because we were compared limited number of parameters. The pie chart was divided into the 3 different reasons. This visual is to be readable by all hence the colour that was chosen considered those with colour blindness.

### Which states have the most cancelled flights?<a name="question4"></a>
 

#### Links:
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sandra1429/viz/CancelledFlightDashboard_16548943689140/FlightCancellationdashboard?publish=yes

#### Summary
This dashboard shows the state in USA with the most cancelled flights during the year. These visuals show that Texas has the most cancelled flights (668 cancelled flights) followed by Illinois with 563 cancelled flights during the year.

#### Design
A dashboard was used because more than one visual was used to represent this (bar chart and a map).
